PE0 on this board has an led.

This board has an 8MHz external (to the chip) clock (HSE), this is more
accurate than the internal HSI clock.  This example switches to that
clock first, then blinks the led on and off for 32 million ticks just
like blinker02, but the HSI (internal) is 16MHz and the HES (external)
is 8MHz so 4 seconds on, for seconds off for the led.


Note it is often dangerous when messing with the clock configuration,
despite decades of experience this is one place where you could brick
the chip.  Should take it slow, good to have a uart setup or some other
way to see the registers as you go, do one step at a time per
experiment.  This is how I did it.  Fortunately with the st chips and
this board we have the boot0 and boot1 pins that gives us an alternate
boot into the bootloader, so we have a way to get unbricked.  In the
future you should consider making your own bootstrap, checking a gpio
pin and dont boot if the pin is pulled one way or the other this way
you can stop the processor before going into the clock init code.  This
all depends heavily on the architecture of the core and the chip.
Some chips the flash can be programmed while the chip/processor core is
in reset making it always safe.  With cores like this that have a
jtag/debug interface the vendors often encourage that to be used, but
if you have switched the chip into a clock that isnt oscillating, then
coming through the debug interface into a hung processor and/or hung
chip wont allow you to reprogram it.  Some MCUs have protection to
prevent you from switching into a dead clock or will switch out of a
clock that dies back into the internal.  Getting too used to these get
out of jail free cards will eventually walk you into a bricked
chip/board someday if you are not a little paraniod and do a little
bit of extra research first as well as take it slow through the init,
one step per experiment.
