See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

PE0 on this board has an led.

The processor core has a timer, this uses the timer.  The internal
clock HSI is 16Mhz, not as accurate as a crystal, but good enough.
The timer is set to 1mhz timeout, 32 of those is 2 seconds, so the
led is on 2 seconds then off 2 seconds.
